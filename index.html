			<p>
			Jim's Cars offers buyers support and advice to help them make better purchasing decisions. We help dealers and private sellers market their vehicles more efficiently by linking them with customers directly. We offer a dealer's location, name, a photo of the sales manager, a dealership rating out of five, and customer feedback to increase consumer confidence. This is to ensure cutomer-buyer satisfaction in <b>every</b> transaction!

			<li>"Flipping"</li>
		</ul>	<br><br>
			<p>
			Low-mileage, reliable sedans, waggons, and small SUVs from mass-market manufacturers such as Ford, Chevrolet, Toyota, and Honda are among the most "flippable" cars and trucks in many areas. These autos have a large number of potential buyers because they are well-known vehicles.

			<li>Electric Vehicles</li>
		</ul> <br><br>
			<p>
			One of the main reasons <abbr title="Electric Vehicles">EV's</abbr> have remained a niche product in the Australian market is range anxiety. 
			However, as electric vehicles have developed, range anxiety is no longer a major concern. With newer models like the Hyundai Kona Electric hitting the market, a realistic range of 400 kilometres or more has reduced range anxiety to a nagging concern.

		<h2>Featured Cars(Pictured, left):</h2>
							
  	<ol><li>Lambhorghini Urus Truck</li></ol>
  		<p>The Lamborghini Urus is the world's first Super Sport Utility Vehicle, combining the soul of a supercar with the utility of an SUV. Urus accelerates from 0 to 62 mph in 3.6 seconds and reaches a high speed of 190 mph thanks to a 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8 engine producing 650 CV and 850 Nm of torque.</p>
  		<ol><li>Ocelot Pariah</li></ol>
  		<p>This isn't a legal street sports car. It won't smack you in the face with its avant-garde bodywork or let you fumble around with its dashboard on the first drive. It's solemn, sophisticated, and even distant. Only the proper handler will be able to see its attractions. After years of practise, though, you will realise your utter contempt for the rest of humanity. </p>
  		<ol><li>Tesla Roadster </li></ol>
  		 <p>The tesla roadster is a <abbr title="Battery Electric Vehicle">BEV's</abbr> sports car, based on the Lotus Elise chassis, that was produced by the electric car firm Tesla Motors in California from 2008 to 2012. The Roadster was the first highway legal serial production all-electric car to use lithium-ion battery cells and the first production all-electric car to travel more than 320 kilometres per charge.<a href="https://www.tesla.com/en_AU/roadster"> More Info</a></p>
